🪺 NetNest

QueenB × AppsFlyer – BeSafe Hackathon 2025

📘 Overview

NetNest is an interactive educational tool developed during the BeSafe Hackathon to raise awareness among teens about appropriate and safe online behavior.
The platform enables students to engage in classroom discussions through real-life scenarios, anonymous submissions, and live voting — all in a fun and collaborative environment.

🎯 Problem

Teens often struggle to discuss sensitive online situations in traditional classroom settings.
Existing solutions lack:

Safe and anonymous ways to share real stories.

Interactive tools to drive engagement.

Real-time insights that encourage meaningful conversations.

💡 Solution

NetNest bridges this gap by turning difficult online behavior topics into interactive classroom discussions.
Students participate in guided “game sessions” where they vote on real-world scenarios and share their opinions anonymously.
The system empowers teachers to lead healthy conversations around digital responsibility and empathy.

Key Features:

Create and manage live classroom sessions.

Students join via a unique room code.

Display random or teacher-selected scenarios.

Real-time voting on whether behaviors are appropriate.

Automatic summary of results for discussion.

Upload new, real-world scenarios anonymously.

🧠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React (Vite)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: Mock data (expandable to real DB)

Architecture: Full-stack MERN-style app

Planned Next Steps:

Integrate AI frameworks for scenario analysis and moderation.

Develop a generalization algorithm to identify behavioral patterns.

Strengthen data privacy and maintain full user anonymity.
